       waits for the elements inside the bode to load.  Therefore

# Google Maps 
    
 Today in class we have discussed *spatial history*, that is, historical work that focusses closely on spatial categories. In class today, our activity will be to reprogram this map: 
    
+ Change the title to represent something more interesting.
+ change the geographical co-ordinates of the marker 
+ change the contents of the info-window 
+ replace this text with a short "essay" in markdown about the event whose marker you are portraying.
