       it calls the function "initialize"

       Javascript in the JS pane will not run properly unless it
       waits for the elements inside the bode to load.  Therefore
       we don't run the most important parts of the code until the page has finished loading.

# Introduction

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, above the map and buttons. To change the bootswatch thenme, change "united" to one of the other theme names listed at [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com/).

Yo might want to restyle the buttons.
<div class="">
  <button onclick="hideMarkers(my_markers)" class="rounded" id="hide">hide markers</button>
  <button onclick="showMarkers(my_markers, my_map)" id="show"> show markers</button>
  <p></p>
  <div id="mapcontainer">
    <div id="map_canvas"></div>
  </div>
</div>
